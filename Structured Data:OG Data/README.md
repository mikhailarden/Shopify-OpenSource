# Shopify-OpenSource
An Open Source Shopify repo. Feel free to contribute and please report bugs if you find any.

If you need help, documentation and other info, please feel free to reach out.

## Getting Started

I assume that you at least have some knowledge of liquid. A lot of the code written is for specific use cases.
Each folder contains a ReadMe which goes through how installation should take place.
